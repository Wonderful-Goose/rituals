## Philosophy

This app is built on a few core beliefs:

1. **Tracking creates awareness** — You can't improve what you don't measure
2. **Consistency beats intensity** — Small daily actions compound
3. **No excuses** — The app won't coddle you or celebrate mediocrity
4. **Privacy first** — All data stays on your device

## Author

Built by Tom because existing habit apps are either too gamified, too bloated, or too soft.
