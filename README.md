## Philosophy

This app is designed for the "hardcore" crowd:

- **No streaks to maintain for the app's sake** - streaks are shown but there's no guilt-tripping
- **No social features** - this is between you and yourself
- **No premium tier** - everything is free and open source
- **No data collection** - your habits stay on your device
- **Minimal but powerful** - every feature earns its place
